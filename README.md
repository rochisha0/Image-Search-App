## Features

- **Search Bar:** Users can enter a search term in the search bar and submit the query.
- **Image Display:** The app fetches images from the Unsplash API based on the user's search term and displays them in a visually appealing format.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
